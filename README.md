# [3D Skins Online](https://openplanet.dev/plugin/3dskinsonline)
3D Skins Online is an [Openplanet](https://openplanet.dev) plugin that makes other people see your custom 3d model skins online!

What this plugin does is basically it forces the server to use the unoptimized download url for the skin you are using. Usually when you upload a skin it gets optimized and a different url gets generated, which is always used by the game by default, but this plugin makes the game use the original download url.
